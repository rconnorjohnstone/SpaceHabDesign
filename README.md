Just a simple repository for the work I do in ASEN5158. If it looks good, I'll eventually make this more professional

## Homework 4

Yet another paper, same format, this time on human factors. It's a very broad topic, so we'll see how it turns out, grade-wise.

## Homework 3

This one will be in the same format as the others. This time on Atmosphere. Need to produce a report on the various atmospheric conditions of past missions as well as the proposed missions of the future. Same format and whatnot.

## Homework 2

Another simple <2 page paper, this time on radiation shielding. The markdown
thing didn't work out all that great, so I'll continue using it for
documentation, but stick with regular LaTeX for the paper itself. I plan on
beginning to build out the formatting and bibliography stuff that I'll use in
the class.

## Homework 1

Homework 1 is a really simple <2 page paper, so I'm going to play around with using `pandoc` and markdown files to generate one that looks nice. Should be really straightforward though, since I won't really need anything complicated. But maybe I'll add some nice pictures or something just for fun.
