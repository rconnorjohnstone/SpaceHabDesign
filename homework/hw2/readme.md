## 3 Methods for mitigating/shielding from radiation effects
Use independent sources, choose some physical some physiological, summarize each
and provide benefits/challenges for each

I would like to do:

- Passive Shielding Approach
    - Water shield
        - Very heavy
        - But the water can be used on the trip
    - Metal Shield
        - Less heavy, but still very heavy
- Active Shielding Approach
    - Electrostatic Shielding
        - No known health risks
        - But a high cost in terms of producing that much electricity in space
    - Magnetic Shielding
        - There are known health risks associated with large magnetic fields
        - So a particular shape would have to be created (torus)
        - Maybe less expensive than an electric field? (TODO: Verify)
    - Plasma Shielding
        - Actually a combination of passive, electrostatic, and magnetic
        - Positive potential repels positive objects
        - A magnetic field brings negative particles to the positively charges
          surface, neutralizing it and creating a passive layer
        - Not well studied
- Physiological (Medical) Approach
    - Antioxidants
        - These generally work on rescuing cells from a particular kind of cell
          death (apoptosis) that isn't necessarily effective in preventing
          cancer
- Could also mention in-situ shielding (as an aside)
