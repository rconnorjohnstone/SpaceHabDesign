# Homework 3

This will be an assignment about atmospheric containment/ECLSS type stuff.

### Exploration Atmosphere

NASA is currently proposing a new gas blend for astronauts labelled "exploration atmosphere" which is 8.2 psia with 34% O<sub>2</sub> and 66% N<sub>2</sub>. This is supposed to enable rapid EVA with minimal gas losses. One downside, though, is that the existing prebreathe (de-nitrogenize) protocols won't work with the new mixture, so they need to come up with new ones. But there is a feasible solution in the works.

This happened in 2012, btw. It has the same ppO<sub>2</sub> as the shuttle missions. There may be some risk of hypobaric hypoxic effects though.

### Mercury

Pure Oxygen at 5.5 psi.

Saved on weight, easier to control, and avoided DCS

### Gemini

The Gemini craft was also pure oxygen. Notably it was at standard pressure just prior to launch. So should the ejection system needed to be tested, it would have been a fire hazard.

### Apollo

Actually two spacecrafts (notably they used 60/40 N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> on
the launch pad, then dropped to these values):

#### Command and Service Module

Command and Service module was the bottom part that held all three astronauts. 5 psi of pure oxygen. Obviously this carries increased risk of fire.

#### Lunar Module

Pretty obvious what this is. Pure oxygen at 4.8 psi. Which is ideal for EVAs so
probably smart.

### SkyLab

Pure oxygen at 5 psi.

### Salyut and Mir

Atmospheric composition.
